SBT plugin that uploads scala code coverage to [https://coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io) and integrates with [Travis CI](#travis-ci-integration). This plugin uses [scoverage](https://github.com/scoverage/scalac-scoverage-plugin/) to generate the code coverage metrics.

For an example project that uses this plugin [click here](https://github.com/scoverage/sbt-scoverage-samples).
For example output [click here](https://coveralls.io/r/scoverage/scoverage-samples)

## Installation

1) Add the following to your `project/build.sbt` file

```scala

addSbtPlugin("org.scoverage" % "sbt-scoverage" % "1.5.1")

addSbtPlugin("org.scoverage" % "sbt-coveralls" % "1.2.4")
```

2) Setup coveralls configuration options (such as [Specifying Your Repo Token](#specifying-your-repo-token))

3) Register on `https://coveralls.io/`

4) Follow the instructions for either [Travis CI](#travis-ci-integration) or [Manual Usage](#manual-usage)

## Travis CI Integration

`sbt-coveralls` can be run by [Travis CI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/) by following these instructions:

1) Add the following to you `travis.yml`

       script: "sbt clean coverage test"
       after_success: "sbt coverageReport coveralls"

    If you have a multi-module project, perform `coverageAggregate`
    [as a separate command](https://github.com/scoverage/sbt-scoverage#multi-project-reports)

       script:
         - sbt clean coverage test coverageReport &&
           sbt coverageAggregate
       after_success:
         - sbt coveralls
      
2) It is important to set the correct `service_name` when using Travis-Pro. The default is to use `travis-ci`. To override this value, add the following to your `build.sbt`:

    ```scala
    import org.scoverage.coveralls.Imports.CoverallsKeys._
    
    coverallsServiceName := Some("travis-pro")
    ```

3) Job done! Commit these changes to `travis.yml` to kick off your Travis build and you should see coverage reports appear on https://coveralls.io/

## Manual Usage

1)  Get the repo token for your repo from http://coveralls.io

1) Let `sbt-coveralls` know what your coveralls repo token is. See [Specifying Your Repo Token](#specifying-your-repo-token)

2) In the SBT console, run `coverage` then your tests finishing with `coveralls`. After running the command, you should see output similar to the following:

    Uploading to coveralls.io succeeded: Job #17.1
    https://coveralls.io/jobs/12207

## Play Framework Integration

There is an issue with the latest version of sbt-coveralls and Play projects created using the default templates on 2.4.x. In order to work around this, we suggest you use the following versions of sbt-coverage/sbt-coveralls in your plugins.sbt

```scala
resolvers += Classpaths.sbtPluginReleases

addSbtPlugin("org.scoverage" % "sbt-scoverage" % "1.0.1")

addSbtPlugin("org.scoverage" % "sbt-coveralls" % "1.0.0")
```

## Specifying Your Repo Token

There are several ways to tell `sbt-coveralls` your repo token to support different use cases:

### Write your repo token into a file

Add the following to your `build.sbt`. The path can be absolute and point to somewhere outside the project or relative and point somewhere inside the project (such as `src/main/resources/token.txt`).

Just remember: **Do not store repo tokens inside your project if it is in a public git repository!**

```scala
import org.scoverage.coveralls.Imports.CoverallsKeys._

coverallsTokenFile := "/path/to/my/repo/token.txt"
```

### Put your repo token directly in your `build.sbt`

**Do not store repo tokens inside your project if it is in a public git repository!**

```scala
import org.scoverage.coveralls.Imports.CoverallsKeys._

coverallsToken := Some("my-token")
```

### Add an environment variable

Add an environment variable `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN`, for example:

    export COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN=my-token

## Specifying Your Coveralls Endpoint

If you're using https://coveralls.io as your endpoint, then you don't need to set this option. If you're using a hosted (enterprise) instance of coveralls, you will need to specify your endpoint in one of two ways.

### Put your endpoint directly in your `build.sbt`

```scala
import org.scoverage.coveralls.Imports.CoverallsKeys._

coverallsEndpoint := Some("http://my-instance.com")
```

### Add an environment variable

Add an environment variable `COVERALLS_ENDPOINT`, for example:

    export COVERALLS_ENDPOINT=http://my-instance.com

### Overriding the current branch

By default `sbt-coveralls` uses the currently checked-out branch for reporting. To override the branch name add the `CI_BRANCH` variable, for example:

    export CI_BRANCH=my-branch-name

## Custom Source File Encoding

By default `sbt-coveralls` assumes your source files are `UTF-8` encoded. To use a different encoding, add the following to your `build.sbt`

```scala
import org.scoverage.coveralls.Imports.CoverallsKeys._

encoding := "ISO-8859-1"
```

Once the plugin has slurped your source code into memory using the specified encoding, it will be converted into UTF-8 to be sent to the coveralls API. This is because the coveralls API uses a JSON request body and RFC 4627 mandates that [JSON must be UTF encoded](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627#section-3).
